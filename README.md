# VietSpeechRecog
My very first machine learning model about Vietnamese speech transcription. It uses the doof-ferb/vlsp2020_vinai_100h dataset from HuggingFace. Here's its link: https://huggingface.co/datasets/doof-ferb/vlsp2020_vinai_100h

##### It is recommended that your disk have more than 150Gb to store the cache. 
We didn't really succeed in training the model because of device problem (yes, even google collab couldn't do it, session timeout). We still didn't know what to do with this model, we'll consider it later.

It is our very first serious project, and we don't have any experience in this.
