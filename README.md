# VietSpeechRecog
My very first machine learning model about Vietnamese speech transcription. It uses the doof-ferb/vlsp2020_vinai_100h dataset from HuggingFace. Here's its link: https://huggingface.co/datasets/doof-ferb/vlsp2020_vinai_100h

It is recommended that your disk have more than 150Gb to store the cache. Python 3.12 is highly recommended since it supports PyTorch with CUDA.

I didn't really succeed in training the model because of device problem (yes, even google collab couldn't do it, session timeout). I still didn't know what to do with this model, I'll consider it later.

It is my very first serious project, and I don't have any experience in this.
